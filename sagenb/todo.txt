Current TODO:
[x] preparser
[x] make sure all "/" is replaced by os.path.join, so will work on windows eventually.
[x] worksheet_process.py -- make it so graphics work, i.e., files created
[x] jsmath
[x] static documentation
[x] jmol
[x] tinymce
[x] @interact -- need to properly preparse and base64 encode maybe?
[x] live documentation
[x] introspection
[x] fill in not implemented stuff
[x] %cython
[x] control-c to stop notebook
[x] write pexpect based worksheet process system using the filesystem as before.
[x] reference should have restart reset state


[ ] implement ulimit/ssh/etc options like before
[ ] start public demo server using ssh
[ ] reimplement sphinx introspection. 
       * confdir in cell.py won't work without a trivial Sphinx directory, when not in Sage. make it.

[ ] hunt for bugs
[ ] make an official spkg
[ ] make patch to remove notebook from sage itself.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] code to benchmark notebook externally
[ ] implement %cython mode outside sage (and as a full mode?)
[ ] fix doctests
[ ] worksheet processes use fork
[ ] worksheet process use multiprocessing 
[ ] worksheet processes using server on remote machine
[ ] genuine infinite undo implemented not using stupid snapshots but a revision log
[ ] @interact: make it so docstring of function is somehow nicely typeset and accessible
[ ] @interact's that can be included with sage


General TODO:

* component architecture: see Brickenstein sage-devel email 
  that mentions http://python-rum.org/browser/rum/component.py

* use memory mapped files for worksheet processes?
