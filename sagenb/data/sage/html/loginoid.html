    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p><strong>Sage</strong> is a different approach to mathematics software.</p>

    <h2>The Sage Notebook</h2>
    <p>With the Sage Notebook
    anyone can create, collaborate on, and publish interactive
    worksheets. In a worksheet, one can write code using Sage, Python,
    and other software included in Sage.
    </p>

    <h2>General and Advanced Pure and Applied Mathematics</h2>
    <p>Use Sage for studying 
    calculus, elementary to very advanced
    number theory, cryptography, 
    commutative algebra, group theory, 
    graph theory, numerical and exact linear algebra, and more.
    </p>

    <h2>Use an Open Source Alternative</h2>
    <p>By using Sage you help to support a viable open source
    alternative to 
    Magma, Maple, Mathematica, and MATLAB.
    Sage includes many 
    high-quality open source math packages.
    </p>

    <h2>Use Most Mathematics Software from Within Sage</h2>
    <p>Sage makes it easy for you
    to use most mathematics software together. 
    Sage includes GAP, GP/PARI, Maxima, and Singular, and
    dozens of other open packages.
    </p>

    <h2>Use a Mainstream Programming Language</h2>
    <p>You work with Sage using the highly regarded 
    scripting language Python.
    You can write programs that combine serious mathematics with
    anything else.   
    </p>
